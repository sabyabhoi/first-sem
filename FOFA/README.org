| The business may not necessarily have to pay the original amount. | The business is obligated to repay the capital amount along with interest. |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The interest amount may vary, or there may be no interest at all. | The interest amount is specified at  the time of the original investment.  |

A liability shall be classified as current when it satisfies any one of the following:
1. It is expected to be settled in the company's *normal operating cycle*. (generally <1 year)
2. It is held mainly for the purpose of *trading*.
3. It is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date.
4. The company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
   liability for /atleast/ 12 months after the reporting data.
**** Significance
- It shows the liquidity position of the company (ability to pay vs. willingness
to pay)
- *Example*: Account payable; expense outstanding.
**** Note
It is not necessary that if the current liabilities of the company are increasing,
then the liquidity position of the company is bad. There are many instances
wherein the *bargaining power* of the company proves to be a valuable resource for
the company.
*** Long Term/Non-current Liability
All other liabilities fall under this category. E.g. Loan taken for 5 years,
Debentures issued, etc.

** Contingent Liability
It represents a *potential obligation* that could be created depending on the
outcome of an event.
